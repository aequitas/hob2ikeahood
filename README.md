# hob2ikeahood

## What is it?

AEG hob2hood support for Ikea Underverk Hoods

AEG hob2hood sends infrared codes from the hob in your kitchen to the hood on top of it.
E.g. AEG IKB84401FB supports this. (https://www.aeg.co.uk/kitchen/cooking/hobs/induction-hob/ikb84401fb/)

I do not have the appropriate AEG hood, that supports the hob2hood function, but rather a cheaper Ikea "Underverk"

## How does it work?

This project consists of a small PCB with some Arduino firmware, which will add hob2hood support to the Ikea Underverk.
It can be connected to sit in between the existing mainboard, and the buttons PCB. This way, no existing functionality is compromised.
You can still use the manual buttons, if you'd like to.

This is what the PCB looks like:

And this is what it looks like, when installed:
